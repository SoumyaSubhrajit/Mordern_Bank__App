// This is the file that basically tells you that
// how this website is built and do and don'ts..


1. Install  the react app through vite
2. Install tailwind and make changes in the config.js file..
3. Make sure we copy and paste the style in the index.css..
4. Then we paste the asset folder and make 2 folder constant, components.
5. In the constant we are makinga "index.js" file and in that file
   IMP: We add all needed text in the website and put inside an array
        So that in Navbar,Footer components we just need to itrate them 
        and make them apper no need to write in manually. 
6. We are using tailwind right so make a "styles.js" and in the file we are just 
   make the syle in a variables like ex:   boxWidth: "xl:max-w-[1280px] w-full",
  so it easy to use the convient purpose..
7. When you download tailwind make sure you done @import 'tailwind/base" Ok and do "npm 
   tailwind init -p" it will work and in case it not work, just restart the app.
